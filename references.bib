abstract = {Blockchain, the underlying technology of cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin, can prove to be essential towards realizing the vision of a decentralized, secure, and open Internet of Things (IoT) revolution. There is a growing interest in many research groups towards leveraging blockchains to provide IoT data privacy without the need for a centralized data access model. This paper aims to propose a decentralized access model for IoT data, using a network architecture that we call a modular consortium architecture for IoT and blockchains. The proposed architecture facilitates IoT communications on top of a software stack of blockchains and peer-to-peer data storage mechanisms. The architecture is aimed to have privacy built into it, and to be adaptable for various IoT use cases. To understand the feasibility and deployment considerations for implementing the proposed architecture, we conduct performance analysis of existing blockchain development platforms, Ethereum and Monax.},

	abstract = {Recent research has focused on applying blockchain technology to solve security-related problems in Internet of Things (IoT) networks. However, the inherent scalability issues of blockchain technology become apparent in the presence of a vast number of IoT devices and the substantial data generated by these networks. Therefore, in this paper, we use a lightweight consensus algorithm to cater to these problems. We propose a scalable blockchain-based framework for managing IoT data, catering to a large number of devices. This framework utilizes the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm to ensure enhanced performance and efficiency in resource-constrained IoT networks. DPoS being a lightweight consensus algorithm leverages a selected number of elected delegates to validate and confirm transactions, thus mitigating the performance and efficiency degradation in the blockchain-based IoT networks. In this paper, we implemented an Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for distributed storage, and Docker to evaluate the network performance in terms of throughput, latency, and resource utilization. We divided our analysis into four parts: Latency, throughput, resource utilization, and file upload time and speed in distributed storage evaluation. Our empirical findings demonstrate that our framework exhibits low latency, measuring less than 0.976 ms. The proposed technique outperforms Proof of Stake (PoS), representing a state-of-the-art consensus technique. We also demonstrate that the proposed approach is useful in IoT applications where low latency or resource efficiency is required.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices generates vast amounts of data, traditionally stored, processed, and analyzed using centralized systems, making them susceptible to attacks. Blockchain offers a solution by storing and securing IoT data in a distributed manner. However, the low performance and poor scalability of blockchain technology pose significant challenges for its application in IoT networks. The primary obstacle is the distributed consensus protocol, while ensuring data transparency, integrity, and immutability in a decentralized and untrusted circumstances which often compromises scalability. To address this issue, this paper introduces the use of the Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithm and sharding techniques to enhance scalability in blockchain-based IoT networks. Experimental results indicate that system throughput increases synchronously with the test load. Our findings reveal a tradeoff between throughput, latency, and up-downstream time on the Inter Planetary File System (IPFS). Given the critical importance of latency and throughput in IoT networks, the results demonstrate that DPoS offers high throughput, parallel processing, and robust security while efficiently scaling the network. Furthermore, at a test load of 500 Transactions Per Second (TPS), the system achieves a maximum throughput of approximately 11.094 ms. However, when the test load exceeds 2000 TPS, the total processing time for transactions extends to 11.205 ms. This method is particularly suitable for constrained IoT networks. Compared to previous edge computing-based approaches, our scheme demonstrates superior throughput performance.},

abstract = {Nowadays, healthcare is growing rapidly due to the large development of new technologies such as IoT and wearable devices. These devices are widely used to ensure remote patient monitoring. The current implementation is based on a client/server architecture. This raises several challenges regarding security and privacy that make healthcare systems more susceptible to several attacks. Therefore, health data are subject to strict regulatory and security requirements. To overcome these challenges and comply with security regulations, the adoption of a distributed architecture is a necessity. Due to its distributed nature and its security promises, Blockchain has a large interest as a sophisticated technology to solve the security challenges in IoT-based systems. Motivated by these factors, this work proposes BlockMedCare, a secure healthcare system that integrates IoT with Blockchain. The system is designed to support remote patient monitoring, especially when it comes to chronic diseases that require regular monitoring. We took into consideration three main parameters: security, scalability, and processing time. The security is ensured by using the re-encryption proxy combined with Blockchain to store hash data. Smart contracts are used for access control. To ensure Blockchain scalability, an off-chain database based on IPFS is used to store data. To speed up the data storage process, we use an Ethereum Blockchain-based proof of authority. As a use case, we applied the system to diabetes management and showed the execution results based on the system interfaces. The experimental system has demonstrated a good improvement of healthcare systems in terms of security face to the existing methods.}
